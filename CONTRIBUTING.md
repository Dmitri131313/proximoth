## Vulnerable Device Detections

There are many devices out there, waiting to be tested. If you would like to send reports about devices which are tested against the `Control Frame Attack`, you can send an email to `technicaluserx@outlook.com`. A template for the e-mail is shown below, doing so will increase the chance of me seeing the reports.

 - Subject:
```
    Proximoth Report
```

 - Body: 
```
    [Proximoth Version]: `Version number of the Proximoth used for detection`
    [Brand]: `Brand name of the device (e.g. Xiaomi)`
    [Model]: `Model name of the device (e.g. Redmi Note 8 Pro)
    [OS Version]: `Operating system version of device (e.g. Android 11 or IOS 15)`
    [OUI]: `First three pairs of MAC address of device (e.g. 1C:CC:D6)`

```
