.SH NAME
\fBproximoth\fR \- Control Frame Attack Vulnerability Detection Tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBproximoth\fR [options] <target>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Proximoth is a command-line tool to detect \fBproximal privacy violation vulnerability\fR in wireless chipsets with
\fBControl Frame Attack\fR. This vulnerability lets an attacker detect the presence of the Wi-Fi device within range
by using the global MAC address of it. Proximoth basically replicates this attack to achieve this goal.
.P
Proximoth does not discover the global MAC address of the target, but it assumes that you already know it or gathered it before.
The expected behaviour from a vulnerable device is to respond with a CTS frame when an RTS frame was sent to its global MAC address.
.P
\fB<target>\fR is the global MAC address of the target Wi-Fi device.
.SH DISCLAIMER
.P
This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without a warranty.
No responsibility will be taken for any illegal activity, use it at your own risk.

.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB\-o <file>, \-\-out-file <file>\fR
        File to write statistics after shutdown.
.P
\fB\-b <bssid>, \-\-bssid <bssid>\fR
        Custom BSSID to be injected as sender MAC address.
        Address is fixed automatically to be global and unicast.
.P
\fB\-a, \-\-no-mac\-autofix\fR
        Disables unicast/global auto fix for BSSID MAC addresses.
.P
\fB\-i <iface>, \-\-interface <iface>\fR
        Wireless interface to use packet injection and sniffing.
        Obligatory option.
.P
\fB\-d <file>, \-\-dump-file <file>\fR
        Write all CTS captures to a PCAP file.
.P
\fB\-r <us>, \-\-rts\-interval <us>\fR
        Microseconds as threshold to wait between RTS injections.
        Setting it to a low value might cause malfunction.
        Default: 500000
.P
\fB\-t, \-\-text\-mode\fR
        Enables text only mode.
.P
\fB\-\-version\fR
        Prints version number and author information.
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
$ sudo \fBproximoth\fR -i wlan0 10:DA:41:E8:FA:DC
.P
$ sudo \fBproximoth\fR -i wlan0 10:DA:41:E8:FA:DC --dump-file dump --out-file record
.P
$ sudo \fBproximoth\fR -i wlan0 10:DA:41:E8:FA:DC --rts-interval 100000
.P
$ sudo \fBproximoth\fR -i wlan0 10:DA:41:E8:FA:DC -b 1C:CC:D6:00:00:00
